# Biography

I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2013 and 2015. Given my interest in optimization, I found it optimal to pursue my education at one of the best engineering schools in the world: UC Berkeley.

I received my second M.Sc. from UC Berkeley in 2016, and Iâ€™m pursuing my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, which is expected to be granted in 2020. During my graduate studies, I developed an interest in online scheduling and project supply chain management, where I can apply my passion for optimization to overcome real-world obstacles.
