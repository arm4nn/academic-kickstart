# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The majority of capital projects are completed after their intended completion date and over budget, often due to inefficiencies in the way their supply chains are managed. After conducting extensive with practitioners in the oil and gas industry, we have identified the relationship between the project schedule and the procurement plan as one cause of these problems. As part of a larger project to develop approaches to simultaneously develop schedules and plan procurement, we need to bound certain online scheduling problems. Here, we prove that the DSPT algorithm is 2-competitive for the online version of minimizing modified total tardiness."
