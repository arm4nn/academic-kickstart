abstract = "Many authors have explored the potential impact of blockchain on supply chain management, and indeed, many articles in the popular press extol the potential of blockchain to impact the supply  chain.   In  this  white  paper,  we  argue  that  while  blockchain  does  have  some  potential to  impact  supply  chains  in  the  short  term,  many  of  the  potential  blockchain-enabled  supply chain impacts will require significant research advances.  We identify four categories of issues that researchers must address in order for many of the interesting proposed blockchain-enabled supply chain use cases to be feasible.  If these issues are addressed, we have little doubt that the potential of blockchain-enabled supply chain is enormous. <br/>  **This research was funded by a grant from the College Industry Council on MaterialHandling Education (CICMHE). P. Kaminsky served on CICMHE from 2014-2017.**"
